# CP3402-Wordpress-Site
Our team has created its own theme and website. This is a business that sells bread and desserts. We built the website in order that our customers can get to know our business in more detail, even if they don't have to come to our shop offline.

The language used to create the theme is css and php. we made it locally and uploaded it to Wordpress, then added a lot of content to complete our site.
